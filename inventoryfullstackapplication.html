      <p class="mb-4"><strong>Situation:</strong> We were tasked with building a full-stack inventory application—Team Rocket Store—using React for the frontend and Express/Sequelize for the backend. The goal was to allow users to add, view, update, and delete items in a store database, and to integrate this across a collaborative, multi-person project using GitHub Boards and PRs.
</p>

      <p class="mb-4"><strong>Task:</strong> As the backend lead, I was responsible for designing and implementing the Express API routes and Sequelize models to support complete CRUD functionality. Our team also needed frontend integration, test coverage, and effective coordination of responsibilities among members.
 </p>

      <p class="mb-4"><strong>Action:</strong> Backend (My Role):

I built robust RESTful API routes to handle item creation (POST), reading (GET all and by ID), updating (PUT), and deletion (DELETE). For deletion, I enforced returning a 200 status on success or a 404 if the item didn’t exist.

I defined the Sequelize model for items with fields name, price, category, description, and image.

I implemented controller logic for each route, handling error cases gracefully.

Frontend (Anthony’s Role):

Anthony designed and implemented the React UI using wireframes to ensure clarity and simplicity.

He built an item card component that dynamically displays name, price, category, and description.

He implemented both list and single-item detail views with options to edit or delete items.

He introduced Tailwind CSS for styling, enhancing the user interface and gaining experience with a modern CSS framework.

Testing & ORM (Mohamed’s Role):

Mohamed wrote end-to-end tests using Jest and Supertest to verify API behavior:

POST to add and confirm new items

PUT to update and validate changes

DELETE to remove items and ensure they no longer exist

GET endpoints to list items and fetch by ID

He also integrated Sequelize into our test setup to confirm real database state.

Team Collaboration:

We used GitHub Boards to assign tasks and track progress: I worked on backend routes, Anthony implemented UI components, and Mohamed handled tests/ORM.

We submitted Pull Requests for each feature, reviewed each other's code, and resolved merge conflicts—giving me firsthand experience resolving Git issues and improving our process.
      <p class="mb-4"><strong>Result:</strong> We successfully delivered a fully functional inventory app with polished UI and backend functionality.

The frontend and backend were tightly integrated, enabling create/read/update/delete operations in real time.

Automated tests validated our API endpoints, saving manual testing time and boosting confidence.

Anthony’s UI—especially using Tailwind—made the application clean and intuitive.

Our use of GitHub workflows and task boards elevated team coordination and conflict resolution skills.

Personally, I deepened my expertise in Express, Sequelize modeling, REST API design, and collaborative coding practices. </p>
