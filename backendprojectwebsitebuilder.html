      <p class="mb-4"><strong>Situation:</strong> The project involves an AI-assisted website builder designed to streamline content creation for merchants. Key components are already in place:

        <section class="mb-4">
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700">
    <li><strong>Core AI Functionality</strong> — The system currently leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate "About Us" text and welcome messages, collaborating with a product team for quality assurance.</li>
    <li><strong>Backend Infrastructure</strong> — Built on FastAPI and deployed to GCP Cloud Run, with a central DS web builder gateway sandbox for routing requests.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Management</strong> — MongoDB is utilized for persistent storage (CRUD operations), and Redis cache is implemented for safety and rate limiting, preventing excessive text generation.</li>
    <li><strong>CI/CD Pipeline</strong> — Jenkins automates the process of building Docker images and pushing them to Google Cloud Run, facilitating continuous deployment.</li>
    <li><strong>Emerging Feature</strong> — An experimental feature for AI-generated images based on merchant metadata has been explored, but these images currently show visible AI-generated characteristics and are not yet ready for production release.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
</p>

      <p class="mb-4"><strong>Task:</strong> The primary goal is to further develop and enhance the AI-assisted website builder, focusing on improving the quality of AI-generated content and ensuring the stability and scalability of the underlying platform. Specific tasks include:

        <section class="mb-4">
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700">
    <li><strong>Content Refinement</strong> — Continue to ensure the LLM-generated "About Us" and welcome messages are high quality and appropriate for merchant use.</li>
    <li><strong>AI Image Production Readiness</strong> — Address the visible "AI‑generated" appearance of images to make them suitable for a seamless user experience and enable their eventual release.</li>
    <li><strong>Platform Optimization</strong> — Maintain and optimize backend services, data persistence, and caching mechanisms (e.g. MongoDB, Redis) for enhanced performance and reliability.</li>
    <li><strong>Streamline CI/CD</strong> — Ensure the Jenkins-driven deployment pipeline remains efficient, robust, and scalable for rapid iteration and deployment.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
 </p>

      <p class="mb-4"><strong>Action:</strong> To achieve the project goals, the following actions will be undertaken:

<section class="mb-4">
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700">
    <li><strong>Refine LLM Text Generation</strong> — Maintain close collaboration with the product team to continuously gather feedback and refine prompts and LLM models for “About Us” and welcome message creation.</li>
    <li><strong>User Feedback Loop</strong> — Implement preference-based feedback mechanisms where merchants rate multiple prompt outputs to guide prompt improvement, which aligns with recent research on human-feedback-driven LLM optimization like APOHF and SIPDO :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.</li>
    <li><strong>Self‑Refine / Iterative Prompting</strong> — Use iterative self-refinement techniques (like Self‑Refine), where initial LLM outputs are self-critiqued and improved over multiple passes to enhance accuracy and tone :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.</li>
    <li><strong>Develop Production‑Ready AI Images</strong> — Explore post-processing techniques (e.g. sharpening, noise addition, style transfer) to reduce “AI-generated” artifacts in visuals and improve realism, a widely adopted best practice in Stable Diffusion workflows :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.</li>
    <li><strong>User Validation</strong> — Conduct internal and limited live testing for AI-generated images to assess merchant acceptance before wider release.</li>
    <li><strong>Enhance Backend & Infrastructure</strong> — Focus on performance and scalability: monitor MongoDB and Redis usage, optimize FastAPI routes and Cloud Run configurations, and conduct security audits of data handling services to mitigate rate-limiting or exposure risks.</li>
    <li><strong>Strengthen CI/CD Pipeline</strong> — Expand automated testing within the Jenkins pipeline and optimize Docker image sizes and build execution times for faster, robust deployments to GCP Cloud Run.</li>
  </ul>
</section>
      <p class="mb-4"><strong>Result:</strong> Successful execution of these actions will lead to significant results for the AI-assisted website builder:
<section class="mb-4">
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700">
    <li>
      <strong>Enhanced Merchant Experience</strong> — Merchants will benefit from an even more intuitive and powerful website builder, capable of generating high-quality, relevant text and, eventually, unique, production-ready AI-generated images.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Increased Content Quality</strong> — The platform will consistently deliver polished and appropriate “About Us” and welcome messages, reducing the manual effort required from merchants.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Unique Customization Options</strong> — The integration of improved AI-generated images will provide merchants with novel and compelling visual content options, helping their websites stand out.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Robust & Scalable System</strong> — The backend infrastructure, backed by MongoDB and Redis, will handle increasing loads efficiently, ensuring a reliable and fast experience.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Rapid Feature Delivery</strong> — A streamlined CI/CD pipeline will enable faster development cycles and quicker deployment of new features and improvements to merchants.
    </li>
  </ul>
